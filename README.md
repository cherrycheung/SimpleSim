# SimpleSim
This environment is a simple simulation engine to view and control a standard VEX Clawbot and move it via motor torques. This is in <b>BETA</b> until a package can be created and some features added, however feel free to test as you like.

#### Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Example
You will notice that the interface to the simulation engine is very similar to Gym's interface, for good reason. It's quite simple to read, and easy to get up and running.

```python
from sim3d import TennisBallClawbotEnv

if __name__ == "__main__":
  env = TennisBallClawbotEnv()

  while True:
    obs = env.reset()
    for step in range(200):
      action = [0] * 10
      action[0] = 0.5 # left
      action[1] = -0.5 # right

      new_obs, reward, term, info = env.step(motors)
      env.render()
```

### Description
A ball is positioned randomly inside of a standard 144"x144" field. The goal of the robot is to navigate to the position of the ball such that the ball is at the center of the claw. This environment is made with Three.js using Ammo/Bullet physics. It runs on Windows/Mac/Linux and does not require a GPU.

### Action Space
Some actions are left intentionally blank to reflect the VEX microcontroller's disconnected ports.

| Num | Action | Control Min | Control Max | Unit |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ---- |
| 0 | Angular velocity target of the left motor | -1 | 1 | rpm (rad/m) |
| 1 | Torque applied on the arm | -1 | 1 | Torque (Nm) |
| 2 | Torque applied on the claw (<i>pending</i>) | -1 | 1 | Torque (Nm) |

| Num | Action | Min | Max | Unit |

| 0 | Chassis position x | -1.83 | 1.83 | position (m) |
| 1 | Chassis position y | -1.83 | 1.83 | position (m) |
| 2 | Counter-clockwise heading of chassis, y-axis=0 | -ùúã | ùúã | radians |
| 3 | Pitch of the arm | -ùúã/2 | ùúã/2 | radians |
| 4 | Arm angular velocity | -inf | inf | rad/s |
| 5 | Ball position x | -1.83 | 1.83 | position (m) |
| 6 | Ball position y | -1.83 | 1.83 | position (m) |
| 7 | Ball distance from claw | 0 | 13.38 | distance (m) |
| 8 | Counter-clockwise heading relative to ball | -ùúã | ùúã | radians |
| 9 | Pitch relative to ball | 0 | 0 | radians |

### Reward
A reward is given based on the distance the claw is from the ball, as well as the difference of the claw's orientation from the direction from the claw to the ball.

`reward = 1 - sum(ball.xyz - claw.xyz).sqrt() - abs(heading - angleto(claw, ball)) / PI`

### Environmental Details
Color and depth frames are shown on a window when `render()` gets called. This window also allows keyboard inputs to be queried, meaning that if you wanted to
manually control the robot, you can call the `env.keys[keyname:str]` api. For example

```python
env.render()
while True:
  a_pressed = env.keys['a'] # 0 or 1
```
